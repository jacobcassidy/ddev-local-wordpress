# DDEV WordPress Setup Scripts

Use for the initial WordPress project installation and setup. You can delete the `ddev-wp-setup-scripts` directory after running the `install.sh` script successfully from your project's root directory. To run the script, use the command `ddev-wp-setup-scripts/install.sh`.

Note: [DDEV](https://ddev.com/) needs to be installed in order for the script to work.
